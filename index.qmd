# Bio 

I am second year PhD student in Pathology & Molecular Medicine graduate program at Yale University. I employ sequence-to-function machine learning models to study the genetic basis of non-coding regulatory elements in the human genome. 



Outside of the lab, I love to travel, read, run, and play tennis. I enjoy watching sports (tennis, Ravens, Giants, Orioles, Devils, Real Madrid). Always looking for recommendations for things to do and learn!
